*** Introduction
The more like a formal induction the better the results can expected
to be, but we need to ensure this does not make the app less intuitive
or accessible.

**** Anxieties, phobias, addictions, lack of motivation
**** Do this in an unobtrusive, engaging and measurably effective way
*** Association
We can change our associations using visual and auditory responses
which link an experience to another one. This can be used to do many
things. At it's most basic we can arouse a positive affect and then
associate the desired meme by displaying them together.
**** Advertising affects us on a daily basis, why not create our own adverts for ourselves to help us lead a better life?

**** learn
**** memorise
**** supermemo / anki memory queue algorithm
**** change the way we feel about something
**** change what something means to us
**** forget something
**** program a complex set of tasks or behaviours
in it's more advanced forms classical conditioning can be used to
build up to complex procedures. in reality this is better done
within the framework of a story or metaphor.
*** Categorisation
Using subliminal motor responses we can measure the categorisation of
a given meme (experience / memory / concept). An example for stopping
smoking would be how closely smoking is categorised with fun,
drinking, socialising, certain times of the day, certain places,
health, family, money, their identity.
**** Priming
Priming has a positive effect, so categorising non-subliminally first
is recommended.

have to research more but TokBox seems the only viable option.
**** Online availbility notification
Allow the speaker to set their status to available and accept speakers
on a first come first served (and acceptance) basis. The buyers can
get instant notifications by email with a link to request a
conversation as soon as the speaker's status has been set to
available. Emphasis should be on the profile of the speaker to provide
verification, to begin we should manually verify profiles of a few
select speakers. For buyers we should also emphasize the importance of
profiles to allow the speaker to select between offers.

** Pedestal App
*** Dataflow Visualisation:
https://github.com/pedestal/app-tutorial/wiki/Increment-the-Counter#dataflow-visualization
*** Overview:
**** Internal data model that holds all info in app
**** 3 queues
***** Input queue
- Receives input messages and passes them to dataflow
***** 
Output queue
- Messages that will be sent to a service i.e. the server
***** App Model queue
- Receives messages re changes to data model
- Changes can be subscribed to by external entities such as the app model consumer. This usually has a rendering function to render deltas on screen.
**** App Deltas
***** 6 different types:
****** :node-create
Create a new node, one operation for each depth of map
****** :node-destroy
****** :value
Set the value of a node, should use 4arg version to avoid confusion, sets the :details attribute
****** :attr
Attributes provide more fine grained control over a node's contents
****** :transform-enable
Sets up messages that can be sent back to the application through the input queue.
****** :transform-destroy
This is the opposite of :transform-enable. It is designed to stop any messages from being sent to the application input queue. For example, if the user is no longer on the todo form, it doesn't make sense to continue to have the ability for the view function to send messages back to the application input queue that have to do with the todo tasks.
**** Dataflow
***** Transform
 A message comes into the dataflow, and the first thing that processes the message is the transform dataflow components. In order for a transform to handle a message, it must first match a message. For a message to match a transform function, two things must match. The message's type must match the transform's key, and the message's topic must match the transform's output path.
 
When a message is found to match a transform dataflow, the transform function is called. This function gets two values. The first value is the old value that was held at the transform's output path. The second value is the message.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; Original data model
{:todo {:tasks [{:id "id1" :details "Pick up milk"}]}}

;; Message
{io.pedestal.app.messages/topic [:todo]
 :io.pedestal.app.messages/type :new-task
 :details "Write a tutorial"}

;; transform function
(defn new-task-handler [old-todo msg]
  (assoc old-todo :tasks
         (conj (:tasks old-todo)
               {:details (:details msg) :id (gensym "id")})))

;; Transform dataflow
[:new-task [:todo] new-task-handler]


;; New data model
{:todo {:tasks [{:id "id1" :details "Pick up milk"}
                {:id "id2" :details "Write a tutorial"}]}}
                
#+END_SRC

So the message is passed to the input queue, and into the dataflow. The only transform component that can handle the message is the one with the key of :new-task and an output task of [:todo]. This is because :new-task matches the message's type, and the [:todo] of the topic matches the transform's output path. Next, the transform function is called, which receives the old todo data along with the message. Inside the function, we are associated the old todo with the tasks. Since tasks is a vector, we are conj'ing the new task onto the old tasks. We automatically create an id, and extract the details from the message and create a map. This is placed in tasks. At the end, the data model is now updated.
***** Derive
When data is changed by a transform or otherwise, any derives
listening for changes on these models are called. Example with
windchill where either temperature or wind-speed change triggers the
wind-chill-fn derive to be called to update the :wind-speed value:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn temperature-fn [old-temp msg]
  (:temperature msg))

(defn wind-speed-fn [old-speed msg]
  (:wind-speed msg))

(defn wind-chill-fn [old-wind-chill inputs]
  (let [t (get-in inputs [:new-model :app :sensor :temperature])
        v (get-in inputs [:new-model :app :sensor :wind-speed])]
    ;; simple wind chill formula is 0.0817 * (3.71v^0.5 + 5.81 – 0.25 V) * (T – 91.4) + 91.4
    (+ (* 0.0817 (- (+ (* (Math/sqrt v) 3.71) 5.81) (* 0.25 v)) (- t 91.4)) 91.4)))

(def dataflow
  {:transform [[:set-temperature [:app :sensor :temperature] temperature-fn]
               [:set-wind-speed [:app :sensor :wind-speed] wind-speed-fn]]
   :derive [[#{[:app :sensor :temperature] [:app :sensor :wind-speed]} [:app :values :wind-chill] wind-chill-fn]]})
#+END_SRC
***** Continue
Continue functions are designed to act as a kind of validation on the data model. It can help make sure the transforms and derives are leaving the data model in a valid state. It does this by sending internal messages that are not visible to the outside world.

Continue dataflow components allow us to de-couple any logic from
inside the dataflow such as deciding when to run two separate
processes by adding messages to an internal queue. They run after the
derive functions have been completed.

First, the transform functions direclty alter the data model by using the message. Next, the derive functions get a chance to run, assuming their inputs change. The derive functions also update the data model. This can lead to other derive functions being called, because it's possible for a derive function to depend on another one. However, at some point, all the derive functions will stop running. Then, it becomes time for the continue functions to run. Continue functions, assuming their inputs change, have the opportunity to create new messages that are put on an internal queue. Each of these messages will be processed, one by one, just like the messages from the normal app input queue. Once all the messages have been processed, the data model will be left in its new, consistent state.

*** groundwork, backwalking <2011-11-02 Wed>
Did some quite intense groundwork today, started off by working with
holding exercises and slow breathing exercises. Holding the pushup was
extremely hard so I should try and work more on that. I should also
work more on keeping my posture - treating it like it's a psyche
exercise.

After that I did ground work with tension, like a grappler. I fared 
fairly well. After that we went on to more relaxing work, pushing and
back walking.

Aran instructed me on the backwalking after he'd done it for me. Start
with the feet, then brush the legs - moving the spine. Then move onto
the thighs and arms. Finally with one foot holding most of the pressure
on the lower back / top of the glutes gently press the other foot on
the upper part of the back, first preparing it similarly to the legs.

*** slow breathing, groundwork, chair <2011-10-24 Mon>
Worked on the slow breathing exercises and ground work. Some of the
strikes at the end brought out some tension just under my solar plexus
which I have been feeling a lot lately. Aran says the way it went in
was like an uppercut going up from my stomach.

The ground work was to move my hips to help movement, starting with
one foot flat and the other bent with foot on the floor, curve the
body to the flat side using the hips to push the body along.

This is useful when learning how to move the whole body as a unit if
for example I were pinned in side control.

I also worked with a chair, learning how to manouver my body whilst
staying relaxed and operate at the same time, e.g. use a TV remote (in
real situations for special forces this would be a weapon). Can also
practice rolling from the chair, softly.

Whenever I do the breathing exercises in the sessions Aran has given
me a different direction, slowly moving towards using less outward
exertion and stress to complete the exercise. Breathing more softly
and lightly without tensing up the neck or face. Breathing in a way
that can be sustained over longer periods of time.

In the slow pushup I've been considering the position of my fists,
whether they need to be closer to my sides since I've a smaller frame
or what angle to my body they should be at. I've been cheating on the
leg raise (as directed by Aran) so that I go quickly to the point at
the top and stay there and try and relax. I've also been doing the
kneeling and going backwards exercise which I am getting more
accustomed to. It is still very hard to stay with my head on the floor
at the end though I am more comfortable in the kneeling position in
general.

*** video, breathing for stomach <2011-09-05 Mon>
Trained today and helped Aran out with video footage of gun
disarming. The rest of the session we worked on relaxation and
stretching exercises for relaxing my stomach.

Lying on the back breathing, on the front with head to either side,
then lying on the back with knees bent, feet and hands flat on the
floor. This is good for the stomach.

After a certain point in these exercises the body may just let go with
a sigh or deep breath. This is the point (sometimes 10 or 15 minutes
needed) that you know the tension has been released.

The other exercise was breathing out completely and continuing to
breathe out even when you feel there is no more air in the lungs. When
you've finished short breathe. This is good for stomach (diaphragm
relaxes the stomach) and for removing tension you may not have known
was there (stale air in the lungs).

*** psyche training <2011-04-20 Wed>
Did some intense training today, water based and endurance. I had no
problem withstanding and enjoyed the level of discipline I now have
over my mind and body. 

Remember to not wear jeans with buttons that dig into my sides as it 
fucking hurts lol.

***** Works best with high motivation and ability
***** Map out a chain of desired behaviours
The takeaway message for designers is to map out the behavior chains you need -- the user flow you want to happen. (You will likely have more than one.) Then figure out how to get people to do the first behavior in a chain. If people don’t naturally take the next step in the chain, then figure out how to get the next step to happen. Step by step. Continue this process, until the chain works.

** Frank Church on the NSA

  Source: [2013-07-27 Sat], [[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/nsa-they-know-much-more-you-think/?pagination%3Dfalse][They Know Much More Than You Think by James Bamford | The New York Review of Books]]

  One man who was prescient enough to see what was coming was Senator Frank Church, the first outsider to peer into the dark recesses of the NSA. In 1975, when the NSA posed merely a fraction of the threat to privacy it poses today with UPSTREAM, PRISM, and thousands of other collection and data-mining programs, Church issued a stark warning:      That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people and no American would have any privacy left, such [is] the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn’t matter. There would be no place to hide. If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology…. I don’t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.
** How to Do What You Love - Expectations

  Source: [2013-07-28 Sun], [[http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html][How to Do What You Love]]

  most people pre-emptively lower their expectations. For example, if you asked random people on the street if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most would say something like "Oh, I can't draw." This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try. Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say "I can't."

** The most coveted experience is the enhancement of self-esteem

  The study published in the journal 'Basic and Applied Social Psychology', is based on a central idea in psychology, that the most coveted experience is the enhancement of self-esteem. The protection, maintenance, or enhancement of feelings of self-worth become vital. One route to feeling good, is to compare oneself with others who seem worse off.

** Difference between unit, integration, functional, acceptance tests?

Source: [2013-07-31 Wed], http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4904096/whats-the-difference-between-unit-functional-acceptance-and-integration-test

Depending on where you look, you'll get slightly different answers. I've read about the subject a lot, and here's my distillation; again, these are slightly wooly and others may disagree.

Unit Tests

Tests the smallest unit of functionality, typically a method/function (e.g. given a class with a particular state, calling x method on the class should cause y to happen). Unit tests should be focussed on one particular feature (e.g., calling the pop method when the stack is empty should throw an InvalidOperationException). Everything it touches should be done in memory; this means that the test code and the code under test shouldn't:

    Call out into (non-trivial) collaborators
    Access the network
    Hit a database
    Use the file system
    Spin up a thread
    etc.

Any kind of dependency that is hard to understand / initialise / manipulate should be stubbed/mocked/whatevered using the appropriate techniques so you can focus on what the unit of code is doing, not what its dependencies do.

In short, unit tests are as simple as possible, easy to debug, reliable (due to reduced external factors), fast to execute and help to prove that the smallest building blocks of your program function as intended before they're put together. The caveat is that, although you can prove they work perfectly in isolation, the units of code may blow up when combined which brings us to ...

Integration Tests

Integration tests build on unit tests by combining the units of code and testing the resulting combination. This can be either the innards of one system, or combining multiple systems together to do something useful. Also, another thing that differentiates integration tests from unit tests is the environment. Integration tests can and will use threads, access the database or do whatever is required to ensure that all of the code and the different environment changes will work correctly.

If you've built some serialization code and unit tested its innards without touching the disk, how do you know that it'll work when you are loading and saving to disk? Maybe you forgot to flush and dispose filestreams. Maybe your file permissions are incorrect and you've tested the innards using in memory streams. The only way to find out for sure is to test it 'for real' using an environment that is closest to production.

The main advantage is that they will find bugs that unit tests can't such as wiring bugs (e.g. an instance of class A unexpectedly receives a null instance of B) and environment bugs (it runs fine on my single-CPU machine, but my colleague's 4 core machine can't pass the tests). The main disadvantage is that integration tests touch more code, are less reliable, failures are harder to diagnose and the tests are harder to maintain.

Also, integration tests don't necessarily prove that a complete feature works. The user may not care about the internal details of my programs, but I do!

Functional & Acceptance Tests

Functional tests usually check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification. Functional tests don't concern themselves with intermediate results or program state (they don't care that after doing x, object y has state z), they are written to test specified behaviour such as, "when the user clicks the magnifying glass button on the side bar, the document is magnified by 25%". It's basically like dropping a coin through a hole in a box and watching to see if something drops from the other end. It either works or it doesn't.

An acceptance test is a particular type of functional test. Acceptance tests are created to mirror the user stories created by/for the software's customer. If the acceptance tests all pass, it means the software should meet all of the user's requirements. An acceptance test suite is basically an executable specification.

The advantage is that the tests are described in plain English and ensures the software, as a whole, is feature complete. The disadvantage is that you've moved another level up the testing pyramid. Functional/Acceptance tests touch mountains of code, so tracking down a failure can be tricky.

Conclusion

They're all complementary. Sometimes it's advantageous to focus on one type or to eschew them entirely. The main difference for me is that some of the tests look at things from a programmer's perspective, whereas others use a customer/end user focus.

** 10 Tips for Sales on Websites from PayPal
Two of the biggest factors in success for online retailers are:

    How many visitors do their websites attract? (for more information see our article How to Attract Customers Through On-Site Search Engine Optimisation)
    When visitors come to the site, do they buy?

Here we offer ten simple tips for your website to help you increase the chance that ‘visitors’ will turn into ‘buyers’.
1. (Proposition) Ask “would a new visitor understand what we do and who we are?”

The biggest and most important tip is to take a look at your site through the eyes of someone who has never seen it before. Visit your homepage, category pages, product pages, and any popular blog posts and ask the question “if I’d never heard of this site before, would I understand what they do, the types of products they stock, and why I should buy from them?” If the answers to any of those 3 questions is “no”, then it’s worth fixing immediately! Kiddicare.com is a great example of this. They recently added ‘Baby Specialist’ beneath the logo, most pages feature offers as well as awards they have won, and the simple categories at the top of every page communicate the range they sell immediately.
As mobile device usage continues to grow, and mobile connection speeds get faster, it’s also worth going through this process on a smartphone. If you are reading on a mobile site, take a look at Firebox.com for a great example of an ecommerce site that communicates what they do, the products they stock, and why you should buy from them very clearly no matter which device you’re using to browse.
2. Update your homepage and plan for frequent updates.

We use the web more and more every year. It’s not uncommon for visitors to return to the same websites (even e-commerce sites) several times a week. In fact, a good proportion of ASOS’s traffic is from visitors returning to the site to see what’s new.
With that in mind, it’s worth giving your homepage a refresh, updating any products, news, and other information there, and putting together a simple plan saying how often you will update the homepage, and what you will change. If you are a Google Analytics user, you can get a rough idea of how often people visit your site from the ‘Days Since Last Visit’ report (found under ‘Audience > Behaviour > Frequency & Recency’).
3. Add payment logos to your footer and a noticeable link to delivery info.

The three key questions every single visitor to your website asks themselves prior to hitting the ‘checkout’ button are:

    “How can I pay for these products?”
    “How much does delivery cost?”
    “How quickly will they deliver?”

Some visitors will have these questions in their mind as soon as they land on the site, some will only think about it at the point they’re ready to purchase. Either way, it is essential to answer all the questions quickly, and without the need for users to hunt around for the answers. Doing this very simple thing can be the deciding factor in whether they buy from you, or drift off elsewhere. The PayPal Logo Centre contains various images to allow you to tell customers you accept PayPal, as well as the many payment method that allows buyers to use.
4. Reviews and testimonials.

Tripadvisor, Yelp, Toptable, Which, and many other companies have built their businesses on the power of reviews. There are three key benefits to reviews:

    If you don’t have reviews, there is a much greater risk of visitors leaving your site to find product reviews elsewhere.
    Even negative reviews are useful. At the point visitors are ready to buy, their last question is often “is there any reason I shouldn’t buy this?” – reading negative reviews and not finding anything particularly bad is often more reassuring than seeing a suspiciously high amount of five star reviews.
    Buyers who do leave a review are almost always more likely to buy from you again.

If you’re able to, collecting and encouraging product reviews is a fantastic way to increase sales. If not, gathering a set of core testimonials from customers is a nice fall-back that reassures potential customers they can trust you.
5. Make sure your phone number is visible (and clickable!).

One of the odd secrets of e-commerce is that a good proportion of the ‘commerce’ part still happens the old fashioned way: over the phone. This is particularly true for higher value products and gifts, where customers want a little bit of final reassurance.
Alongside that, more and more customers now shop using their phones, where it’s often just as easy to click a phone number to purchase as it is to buy direct from the website.
Make sure your phone number is visible to catch anyone who may need a couple of final questions answering before they purchase. And make sure it’s clickable to catch extra sales from mobile customers who are happier buying over the phone.
PayPal’s Virtual Terminal makes all of this a little easier, by allowing you to take payments over the phone.
6. Clean up images on your top products.

Photos and images are one of the key selling points on a website, but it can be very costly and time consuming to take multiple high quality photos of every product on your website. Thankfully, the ’80:20’ rule often applies on websites, meaning 20% of the products on any website receive 80% of the views (often even more).
Take a quick look at the stats for your website, find out which are the most viewed products (often these differ from the most purchased), and go through the top 10 or top 20 making sure they each have multiple photos, and that every photo is more appealing than your nearest competitor.
7. Stock and availability.

One of the big, big, big factors in online retail is stock. If a customer can see that your product is in stock, they are more likely to buy it. This is especially true in fashion, but it does apply in other areas too. So much so that simply adding the phrase ‘In Stock’ on pages where it wasn’t previously featured has been known to improve sales.
Alongside this, it’s important to make sure the products you feature are in stock. If they’re not in stock, promote others a little more heavily on your homepage, category pages, and marketing instead. And, if you are able, ensure all of your stock is listed online.
8. Site search.

Econsultancy consultant Dan Barker notes “On most e-commerce sites, between 4-8% of visits will use the on-site search tool. But, in visits where the user landed on the site intending to buy, this can shoot up dramatically to 15-20% of visits.” When visitors come to your site intending to purchase something very specific, they may often use on-site search father than hunting through navigation options.
Take a look at the search terms your visitors use on the site, and make sure there are products listed for each, or that key questions are answered. Some retailers do this every few weeks to make sure they understand what potential customers are looking for, and to make sure customers can find the products they’re looking for! Doing this fairly frequently can reap big rewards.
9. Gather feedback.

It almost doesn’t need saying, but asking your customers what they think of you, of your site, of your products, and making sure you hear about any problems they have, can fundamentally change your business.
You may choose to do this through occasional surveys, emails to customers, or you may choose to use a live chat tool like Olark, or a constant feedback gathering tool like Qualaroo. However you do it, you should absolutely be gathering feedback from customers.
10. Tie in email and social media.

Finally, one of the best ways to ‘refresh’ your website is to make sure you connect with customers and potential customers via social media and email. This means trying to gather their email address so that you can continue to communicate with them, and nudging them toward following you on social media.
Doing both of these not only gives you an opportunity to market products to them, and build your relationship with them in the future, it also means you can communicate any changes you make to the site in future immediately and gather instant feedback!
Summary

There you have it: 10 simple tips any e-commerce site can apply to make sure you maximise the chance of a ‘visit’ to the site turning into a ‘happy customer’.
