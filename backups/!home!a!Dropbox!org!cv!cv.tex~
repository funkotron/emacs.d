authenticate and authorise oAuth services by both carers
on the web interfaces or by the end users on mobile devices.

My work also included making a social news feed service pulling information
from facebook and a news feed parser that allows a carer to select from
Tiscali's rss feeds on the web interface and the end user to read
these from their mobile device.
