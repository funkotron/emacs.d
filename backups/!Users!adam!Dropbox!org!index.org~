*** Goals
**** Get a minimal encrypted social setup going
***** TODO How to generate keys
****** Create a library (fine grained abstraction) for encryption handling with a Protocol
****** Masterpass encrypts random sjcl ecc key with AES if none on email
****** Encrypted key is stored on server on email record
****** Login again pulls and decrypts the key with re-entry of masterpass
***** TODO Encrypt a piece of content using hybrid encryption
***** TODO Add Content Security Policy
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/#use-case-1-social-media-widgets
***** TODO Add TLS
*** Concepts
**** What are the key abstractions?
***** Message
****** direct? (to:)
****** medium(twitter,facebook,blog,email,chat)
****** tags[friends,tech,art]
****** visibility(fn (filter hasperm? msg))
****** media[photo,video,audio,game]
****** text [style]
****** location
****** link (bookmarks / embedded)
**** What do people want in a social network that fb & twitter doesn't provide
***** Privacy
****** ECC and AES Hybrid: http://justinthomas.pro/crypto/test.html#encryptedtextalice
***** Natural interactions (as offline)
****** [#B] WebRTC with websockets https://webrtc-experiment.appspot.com/
***** Relevance, interest and personal interactions
****** Filtering - preferably with database layer - Prismatic Store
***** A focus on interaction
****** UI that segments based on interaction (who with, what time, about what)
****** An abstraction over interaction.
***** If you want to check up on how your friend is doing, you would use this.
****** Ability to actively check a friend's feed
***** If you want to tell people about how you are doing, you would use this.
****** Ability to selectively publish content. This is the life blood of the system and should be well tuned.
***** If you want to learn more about things relevant to your interests you would use this.
****** Filter based on topic / tag
***** Paid (subscribable) feeds (v2)
**** Get started with Prismatic's Graph
**** Use a protocol to define messages
***** TODO Learn protocols
**** Try and get Prismatic's Store
**** Recommended tag for friends to recommend an item
**** function to add a tag to a message (email or other) map
**** email direct tagged or subscribers
**** set small targets
*** Design
**** Control Panel view?

** Memeplex.io
*** Introduction
The more like a formal induction the better the results can expected
to be, but we need to ensure this does not make the app less intuitive
or accessible.
*** TODO Read [[file:~/Dropbox/research/Persuasive_Advertising.pdf][Persuasive Advertising]]
*** TODO Read [[file:~/Dropbox/research/Advances_in_Advertising_Research.pdf][Advances in Advertising Research]]

**** Measuring & altering state
**** Recording & Changing associations
**** Changing thoughts, perceptions, beliefs and habits
**** Anxieties, phobias, addictions, lack of motivation
**** Do this in an unobtrusive, engaging and measurably effective way
*** Association
We can change our associations using visual and auditory responses
which link an experience to another one. This can be used to do many
things. At it's most basic we can arouse a positive affect and then
associate the desired meme by displaying them together.
**** Advertising affects us on a daily basis, why not create our own adverts for ourselves to help us lead a better life?
***** “Drink Coca-cola, Eat popcorn” -> James Vicary (1957)
***** McDonalds subliminal on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMzbwa6PvEE
**** learn
**** memorise
**** supermemo / anki memory queue algorithm
**** change the way we feel about something
**** change what something means to us
**** forget something
**** program a complex set of tasks or behaviours
in it's more advanced forms classical conditioning can be used to
build up to complex procedures. in reality this is better done
within the framework of a story or metaphor.
*** Categorisation
Using subliminal motor responses we can measure the categorisation of
a given meme (experience / memory / concept). An example for stopping
smoking would be how closely smoking is categorised with fun,
drinking, socialising, certain times of the day, certain places,
health, family, money, their identity.
**** Priming
Priming has a positive effect, so categorising non-subliminally first
is recommended.

****** Gauranteed refund (7 days?)
**** Integration with existing networks
Since Facebook is developing a similar product, Twitter is a more
suitable target integration network. As for IM integrations I will
have to research more but TokBox seems the only viable option.
**** Online availbility notification
Allow the speaker to set their status to available and accept speakers
on a first come first served (and acceptance) basis. The buyers can
get instant notifications by email with a link to request a
conversation as soon as the speaker's status has been set to
available. Emphasis should be on the profile of the speaker to provide
verification, to begin we should manually verify profiles of a few
select speakers. For buyers we should also emphasize the importance of
profiles to allow the speaker to select between offers.

*** groundwork, backwalking <2011-11-02 Wed>
Did some quite intense groundwork today, started off by working with
holding exercises and slow breathing exercises. Holding the pushup was
extremely hard so I should try and work more on that. I should also
work more on keeping my posture - treating it like it's a psyche
exercise.

After that I did ground work with tension, like a grappler. I fared 
fairly well. After that we went on to more relaxing work, pushing and
back walking.

Aran instructed me on the backwalking after he'd done it for me. Start
with the feet, then brush the legs - moving the spine. Then move onto
the thighs and arms. Finally with one foot holding most of the pressure
on the lower back / top of the glutes gently press the other foot on
the upper part of the back, first preparing it similarly to the legs.

*** slow breathing, groundwork, chair <2011-10-24 Mon>
Worked on the slow breathing exercises and ground work. Some of the
strikes at the end brought out some tension just under my solar plexus
which I have been feeling a lot lately. Aran says the way it went in
was like an uppercut going up from my stomach.

The ground work was to move my hips to help movement, starting with
one foot flat and the other bent with foot on the floor, curve the
body to the flat side using the hips to push the body along.

This is useful when learning how to move the whole body as a unit if
for example I were pinned in side control.

I also worked with a chair, learning how to manouver my body whilst
staying relaxed and operate at the same time, e.g. use a TV remote (in
real situations for special forces this would be a weapon). Can also
practice rolling from the chair, softly.

Whenever I do the breathing exercises in the sessions Aran has given
me a different direction, slowly moving towards using less outward
exertion and stress to complete the exercise. Breathing more softly
and lightly without tensing up the neck or face. Breathing in a way
that can be sustained over longer periods of time.

In the slow pushup I've been considering the position of my fists,
whether they need to be closer to my sides since I've a smaller frame
or what angle to my body they should be at. I've been cheating on the
leg raise (as directed by Aran) so that I go quickly to the point at
the top and stay there and try and relax. I've also been doing the
kneeling and going backwards exercise which I am getting more
accustomed to. It is still very hard to stay with my head on the floor
at the end though I am more comfortable in the kneeling position in
general.

*** video, breathing for stomach <2011-09-05 Mon>
Trained today and helped Aran out with video footage of gun
disarming. The rest of the session we worked on relaxation and
stretching exercises for relaxing my stomach.

Lying on the back breathing, on the front with head to either side,
then lying on the back with knees bent, feet and hands flat on the
floor. This is good for the stomach.

After a certain point in these exercises the body may just let go with
a sigh or deep breath. This is the point (sometimes 10 or 15 minutes
needed) that you know the tension has been released.

The other exercise was breathing out completely and continuing to
breathe out even when you feel there is no more air in the lungs. When
you've finished short breathe. This is good for stomach (diaphragm
relaxes the stomach) and for removing tension you may not have known
was there (stale air in the lungs).

*** psyche training <2011-04-20 Wed>
Did some intense training today, water based and endurance. I had no
problem withstanding and enjoyed the level of discipline I now have
over my mind and body. 

Remember to not wear jeans with buttons that dig into my sides as it 
fucking hurts lol.

***** Works best with high motivation and ability
***** Map out a chain of desired behaviours
The takeaway message for designers is to map out the behavior chains you need -- the user flow you want to happen. (You will likely have more than one.) Then figure out how to get people to do the first behavior in a chain. If people don’t naturally take the next step in the chain, then figure out how to get the next step to happen. Step by step. Continue this process, until the chain works.
